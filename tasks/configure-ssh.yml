# Manages SSH configuration

# This task is repeated as a different handler needs to be called depending on the OS.
# A different handler is needed because there is a bug with restarting the SSH Daemon on Ubuntu.

# Normally we would use a single template task and set fact to feed in the name of the service to restart in a common
# handler. However, in this case, the handler requires the use of a different Ansible module for each OS.
